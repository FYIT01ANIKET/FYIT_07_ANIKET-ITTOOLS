BASIC UNDERSTANDING ON FREE AND OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
A ) Describe Open-Source Software with Example.
Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
"Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.
Example : LibreOffice, GNU/Linux, VLC, Media Player, Mozilla Firefox, GIMP, VNC, Apache web server and jQuery.

B)  Describe Free Software with Example
“Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price
The free software definition presents the criteria for whether a particular software program qualifies as free software. From time to time we revise this definition, to clarify it or to resolve questions about subtle issues. See the history section below for a list of changes that affect the definition of free software.
Example : Linux kernel, the BSD and Linux operating systems, the GNU Compiler Collection and C library the MySQL relational database 

C) Difference's :-
FREE SOURCE SOFTWARE
•	The freedom to deploy the software for any use case without any restrictions.
•	The freedom to study how the software works and modify it according to your needs and preferences.

•	The freedom to freely re-distribute the software to assist someone in need. The redistribution can be done at a cost or at no cost.

•	The freedom to enhance the performance of the software and release your enhancements for the community to benefit—both programmers and non-programmers. You can do this at a cost or at no cost
OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
•	Free redistribution of the software.
•	The source code should be publicly available
•	The software can be modified and distributed in a different format from the original software.
•	The software should not discriminate against persons or groups.
